# Information

* This is a basic project by myself to learn more about CPU processing and general C and Assembly code.
* This is in no means something to copy or make your project in model of. This repository will likely not consist of best-practices.

# CPU Specifications

## What is it called?

* Currently it's development name is ALR88

## Explain it further?

* A 8-bit CPU with 8-bit addressing

## 8 Bits?

* 8 bits or 1 byte is used to store information, the least value possible to represent in storage would be hex 0x00, the largest value representing hex 0xFF. That being values 0 to 255. Values are stored in unsigned bytes.

## 8 Bit Addressing?

* 8 bit addressing signifies there are storage locations hex 0x0 to hex 0xFF.
* This allows for 255 possible 1 byte memory locations, 2040 bits of memory or 255 bytes.

## Notes

* General notes go here

## To-Do

### Present

* Determine operations and opcodes
* Basic logical operations
* Implement basic accumulator register and operations
* Implement general purpose 8 bit registers
* Basic memory and registers
* General standard for opcodes and their decoding
* Loading of ROM machinecode

### Future

* Possibly implement a stack and stack operations
* 16 bit registers and operations
* RAM bank swaping
* Specification of RAM bank amount by the assembler
* Additional 8 bit registers
* Labels
* Jumping to labels
* Conditional jumps dealing with flags
* VGA graphics handling of some type
* Support of sprites

## To-Do: Additional Documentation
